    <p>I completed the large-scale reorganzing of the site. The individual waterfall pages are now
      all in separate folders by state. I fixed as many links as I could find that needed fixing.
      Let me know if you discover any broken ones!</p>

    <p>Because it has been a long time since I've worked on this site, many of the links to
      external sites are broken or obsolete. I'm starting to repair those links to make the
      information presented here more useful and current.</p>

    <p>I've also started moving the waterfall pages for the various states into their own folders.
      This won't affect the casual visitor (although if you've bookmarked a specific waterfall
      page, you'll have to update your bookmark to reflect the new location). However, this change
      does make the site more organized from my point of view, and that will help with future work
      on it.</p>

    <p>Finally, I've refocused the site exclusively on the waterfalls of New England, meaning the
      states Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. In the
      past I had a slightly expanded scope that included parts of New York and, potentially,
      Qu√©bec. There are other sites that cover those regions, and I decided I want to keep the
      scope of this page more tightly defined.</p>

    <p>There is a <a href="https://www.newenglandwaterfalls.com/">NewEnglandWaterfalls.com</a>
      page by Greg Parsons related to a book he co-authored named <i>New England Waterfalls</i>. I
      feel the name of my page is distinct enough from his to avoid confusion. In any case, I've
      been using the "Waterfalls of New England" name since 1995 when I first started this page.
      My intent is to not in any way detract from Greg's work (or his book). In fact, I feel quite
      the opposite. If you are interested in this coverage area, you should absolutely check out
      his site!</p>

    <p>And speaking of 1995... It will soon be the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of this site. On
      March 25, 1995, I visited <a href="VT/texas.html">Texas Falls</a> and recorded that visit
      here as my first entry. I want to do something special to celebrate 30 years of being on the
      web, but I'm not sure yet what that should be.

    <p>I've started the long process of updating this site to use more modern web technologies. It
      will take time for me to get around to updating all the pages, so please be patient. In the
      meantime, you will likely find a lot of inconsistencies from page to page and maybe some
      broken things as well. I hope in the long run it will become a much nicer and more useful
      site.</p>

    <p>I also hope to start visiting waterfalls again and get some new and updated content as
      well!</p>
