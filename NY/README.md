This folder contains waterfall pages and photographs of falls in New York state. An earlier
version of this website included parts of New York in its scope, and these pages were added
at that time. Currently this website focuses exclusively on the waterfalls of New England,
so these pages have been disconnected from the main site. I did not delete them, however, in
case they prove useful in the future.

These pages are current as of October 17, 2024. They are not maintained, and so do not reflect
changes made to the rest of the site since that date. These pages are retained for achival
purposes.
