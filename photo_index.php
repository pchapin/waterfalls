<h1>Waterfall Pictures</h1>
<hr/>
<p>This is a list of all the large waterfall pictures that I have on my site. I (Peter Chapin)
  took Most of these pictures. However, some of them, as noted below, were taken by others. These
  pictures are intended to be my best. You can find smaller versions of many of these pictures, as
  well as additional pictures not represented here, on the description pages of the falls.</p>

<p>Photographing waterfalls can be difficult. If you are interested in trying it, here is some <a
    href="photo_technique.html">advice</a> I might offer.</p>

<p>My favorite pictures are those of <a href="photos/hamilton1.jpg">Hamilton Falls</a>, <a
    href="photos/moss-glenn-granville-01.jpg">Moss Glen Falls</a>, <a href="photos/oldjelly.jpg">Old
  Jelly Mill Falls</a>, and <a href="photos/doanes1.jpg">Doane's Falls</a>.</p>
<ul>

  <!-- I've got a lot more large format guest pictures than are listed here. Should I list all of
  them, or should I attempt to gradually remove all of my guest photos? -->
  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/bailey-01.jpg">Bailey Falls</a> [130 KBytes]. Nice picture of the full
      falls. This photo is a little too yellow. My friend John Bedard is standing at the base of
      the falls for scale.(<a href="bailey.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/bartlett.jpg">Bartlett Falls</a> [104 KBytes]. A relatively large falls on
      a significant river. I took this picture with the wide angle lens. It shows. (<a
          href="bartlett.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="guest_photos/bashbish.jpg">Bash Bish Falls</a> [157 KBytes]. This photo was taken
      by my friend John Bedard during one of his road trips. It was a 4x6 inch print making for a
      larger image than those made by my usual 3x5 inch prints. It's a nice picture, however. (<a
          href="bashbish.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/bingham.jpg">Bingham Falls</a> [111 KBytes]. This is a picture of the main
      part of the falls taken in the summer. The pool below the falls is very beautiful, but this
      picture doesn't convey that as well as I'd like.(<a
          href="bingham.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/bridal.jpg">Bridal Veil Falls</a> [133 KBytes]. This is a nice picture of
      the upper falls. I had to scramble up some rather slippery, moss-covered rocks to get this
      picture, but I think it was worth it. (<a href="bridal.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/campbell1.jpg">Campbell Falls</a> [135 KBytes]. This picture was taken
      directly across the ravine from the falls. It doesn't show the full falls, but it still
      makes them look rather impressive. I had to lighten all of my pictures of Campbell Falls
      significantly using software. (<a href="campbell.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/campbell2.jpg">Campbell Falls</a> [129 KBytes]. This picture was taken from
      the bottom of the falls. It shows both the lower and upper portions. The lower part is
      actually a good deal smaller and closer than the upper part, but in this picture they almost
      look as if they are of a similar size. (<a href="campbell.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/campbell3.jpg">Campbell Falls</a> [135 KBytes]. This picture shows just the
      main (upper) part of the falls. It gives you a nice view of the rocky ravine surrounding the
      falls. (<a href="campbell.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/campbell4.jpg">Campbell Falls</a> [95 KBytes]. April 1997. This picture
      shows the full falls. Film: Kodak Gold, ASA 200. (<a href="campbell.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/doanes1.jpg">Doane's Falls</a> [83 KBytes]. April 1997. This is the last of
      a beautiful series of waterfalls along Lawrence Brook in Royalston, Massachusetts. This is
      one of my better pictures, but it is marked by a slight scratch across the center. I don't
      know the people in this picture, but their image is published here with permission. Film:
      Kodak Gold, ASA 200. (<a href="doanes.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/dogs-head-01.jpg">Dog's Head Falls</a> [110 KBytes]. The Lamoille River
      grinds its way through a stubborn rock formation. (<a href="dogshead.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/glen.jpg">Glen Falls</a> [149 KBytes]. These falls are located in a deep,
      dark forest glen. I took this picture in early April. The main falls are covered with a very
      interesting ice formation. (<a href="glen.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/glendale1.jpg">Glendale Falls</a> [146 KBytes]. The upper part of a large
      and interesting falls complex. This picture gives you a good feeling for what Glendale Falls
      is like, although it doesn't begin to show you all there is to see. (<a
          href="glendale.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/glendale2.jpg">Glendale Falls</a> [141 KBytes]. A side view of the
      midsection of the falls complex. In low water you can walk right out onto those rocks. Very
      nice. (<a href="glendale.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/glendale3.jpg">Glendale Falls</a> [145 KBytes]. The lower section of the
      falls. The edge seen in the distance is not the top. All the falls shown in my <a
          href="photos/glendale1.jpg">first picture</a> is above that edge! (<a
          href="glendale.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/glendale4.jpg">Glendale Falls</a> [154 KBytes]. One part of the lower
      section of the falls. This was taken when the water was relatively low. It's a nice shot,
      but it would have been nicer with more water. (<a href="glendale.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/hamilton1.jpg">Hamilton Falls</a> [134 KBytes]. Very nice shot of the falls
      at high water. This is a very impressive waterfall. (<a href="hamilton.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/kinsman.jpg">Kinsman Falls</a> [136 KBytes]. This shot was taken with a
      telephoto lens and is quite nice. The falls are not actually all that high, but this photo
      makes them look rather impressive. (<a href="kinsman.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/lana.jpg">The Falls of Lana</a> [137 KBytes]. The falls as seen from above.
      It's a very interesting waterfall, but the vantage point of this photograph does not do it
      justice. (<a href="lana.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/lana2.jpg">The Falls of Lana</a> [137 KBytes]. The upper falls. There are
      really two falls in this picture, one behind the other. These falls are above those in the
      first picture of the Falls of Lana (see above). (<a href="lana.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/moss-glenn-granville-01.jpg">Moss Glen Falls #1</a> [119 KBytes]. Very nice
      photo of a photogenic waterfall. It's not quite centered because I had to avoid getting the
      annoying boardwalk in the field. This was taken in late autumn. Note the ice around the
      fall's edges. (<a href="moss-glen-granville.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/oldcity-02.jpg">Old City Falls</a> [120 KBytes]. The main falls at low
      water. Very graceful. (<a href="oldcity.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/oldcity-03.jpg">Old City Falls</a> [112 KBytes]. The main falls at low
      water seen from the side. This picture isn't quite as clear as I would like, but it's still
      decent. This picture was taken on the same day as the one above. (<a
          href="oldcity.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/oldcity-04.jpg">Old City Falls</a> [143 KBytes]. This picture was taken
      during the wet, rainy summer of 1996. The water is high and the falls are beautiful. (<a
          href="oldcity.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/oldjelly.jpg">Old Jelly Mill Falls</a> [143 KBytes]. This is a nice photo
      of gentle falls flowing through an autumn forest. (<a href="oldjelly.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/race1.jpg">Race Brook Falls</a> [143 KBytes]. A view of the lower falls.
      This is only one of a whole series of beautiful waterfalls along Race Brook. It's a very
      impressive place. (<a href="race.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/race2.jpg">Race Brook Falls</a> [151 KBytes]. The upper falls. The water
      churns down a narrow chute. (<a href="race.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/royalston.jpg">Royalston Falls</a> [95 KBytes]. April 1997. This waterfall
      pours into a deep, circular chasm. A nice picture despite the overexposed foreground rocks.
      Film: Kodak Gold, ASA 200. (<a href="royalston.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/smalls4.jpg">Smalls Falls</a> [142 KBytes]. This is the main falls as seen
      from across the pool at the bottom of the falls. I took this picture from the walkway just
      on the other side of the bridge from the parking lot. I'm sure everyone who visits Smalls
      Falls has a picture like this one. (<a href="smalls.html"
      >Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/smalls2.jpg">Smalls Falls</a> [144 KBytes]. This is the upper portion of
      the falls as taken from the rocks above. None of the action in this picture is visible in my
      <a href="photos/smalls1.jpg">first one</a>. However, the smaller drop in the background of
      this picture is displayed in greater detail in my <a
          href="photos/smalls3.jpg">third picture</a>. This gives you some idea of how extensive
      these falls are. (<a href="smalls.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/smalls3.jpg">Smalls Falls</a> [112 KBytes]. This is a section of the stream
      above the major part of the falls. Smalls Falls has quite a few drops and, frankly, I rather
      like the more obscure, less visited upper ones. The extreme contrast in this picture was a
      challenge. The water is very over exposed, but it's a good picture anyway. (<a
          href="smalls.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/step1.jpg">Step Falls</a> [112 KBytes]. This is a nice overview of one
      interesting section of the falls complex. The stream divides into two delicate sections that
      flow into a large, deep pool at the bottom of the picture. This picture was taken at a time
      of unusually low water. (<a href="step.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/texas.jpg">Texas Falls</a> [115 KBytes]. View of one part of the main falls
      at low water. This picture gives you a good feeling for the gorge through which the falls
      flows. In higher water it's quite an interesting sight. However, in higher water, I doubt
      very much if I would be able to stand where I got this picture. (<a
          href="texas.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/umpachene.jpg">Umpachene Falls</a> [94 KBytes]. April 1997. A rather nice
      waterfall in south-western Massachusetts. This is just the upper section. The lower section
      has a similar height. The bright, sunny day makes for an energetic picture. Film: Kodak
      Gold, ASA 200. (<a href="umpachene.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="guest_photos/wahconah_large.jpg">Wahconah Falls</a> [199 KBytes]. High water makes
      for an impressive waterfall. This picture was taken by my friend John Bedard. (<a
          href="wahconah.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/weathersfield1.jpg">Weathersfield Road Cut Falls</a> [144 KBytes]. This
      rather nice falls appeared unannounced in a road cut along US Rt. 5 in Weathersfield, VT. My
      daughter Hillary is standing beside the falls. (<a
          href="roadcut.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="photos/wjambs.jpg">Windsor Jambs</a> [120 KBytes]. The river churns in the gorge
      below. This picture was taken from above and doesn't look like much. (<a
          href="wjambs.html">Description</a>)</p>
  </li>
