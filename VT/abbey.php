</p>
<p><b>From East Middlebury</b></p>

<p><img src="photos/abbey_upper-02.jpg" alt="Abbey Pond Cascades, Upper Falls" style="float:
    right; padding: 10px"/>Take <span class="road-name">Rt. 116</span> north from its intersection
  with <span class="road-name">Rt. 125</span> in the center of <span
      class="town-name">East Middlebury</span>. Travel a little over four miles to a dirt road on
  the right (East). There is a small sign for Abbey Pond Cascades along the road, but it would be
  easy to miss if you are not watching for it.</p>

<p>Immediately after turning off the main road, the dirt road forks. Follow the right-hand fork;
  there is no parking at the main road. After a short distance (perhaps half a mile) there is a
  turnoff on the left into a moderately large parking area. The turnoff is marked with a sign
  for the falls.</p>

<p>A trail leaves the back of the parking area. It skirts around a gravel pit and shortly crosses
  into the Green Mountain National forest. From there it is only a few yards to the falls. The
  trail crosses the stream on a wooden bridge between the lower and upper falls. To view the
  entire falls, you will want to explore both downstream and upstream from the bridge.</p>

<p>The trail continues on to Abbey Pond. It's a moderate hike of about two miles to the pond.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><img src="photos/abbey_lower.jpg" alt="Abbey Pond Cascades, Lower Falls" style="float:
    left; padding: 10px"/> Abbey Pond Cascades is a complex of waterfalls in a heavily wooded
  grotto. From the bridge one can look upstream into a narrow gorge and see a significant drop at
  the end of the gorge. By scrambling up alongside the stream you can see even more cascades above
  the gorge. The rocky crags make approaching the stream somewhat difficult, but it is easy to
  find places above the water to sit.</p>

<p>If you don't mind getting your feet wet, you can wade in the stream from the bridge to a rock
  shelf that goes into the gorge just below the falls there. If you attempt this, proceed with
  caution and use as many stepping stones as possible!</p>

<p>To see the lower falls, you will want to scramble downstream a bit. The main part of the lower
  cascades is right below the bridge, so you don't have to go far. There are some excellent
  vantage points on some rocks opposite the bridge from which the entire lower section can be
  easily seen (see a photograph to the left).</p>

    <p>I have visited these falls a couple of times over the years since 2006. Today was a brisk,
      cloudy day, but with no snow or ice. The falls were in good form with enough water to
      create an interesting view, but not overwhelming.</p>

    <p>I hiked to the pond as well. At one point the trail, which had been following the stream on
      the left, turned right (south) away from the stream. Just before this point there was a <a
          href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/44%C2%B002'04.9%22N+73%C2%B004'39.7%22W/@44.03469,-73.079887,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d44.0346896!4d-73.0776934">stream
        junction below and to the left of the trail</a>. The right-hand fork of the stream
      appeared to come down a steep grade, and there were hints of another waterfall visible
      through the trees. Accessing the area would require bushwhacking about 100 yards down the
      embankment on the left side of the trail, across the stream, and then up the opposite grade.
      I did not try that today, but it might be worth exploring the area more in the future.</p>

    <p>Today my daughter Hillary and I visited these falls for the first time. It was a
      beautifully clear day but not at all hot. It was also too early in the season for bugs. We
      were surprised at how close to the parking lot and how easily accessible the falls were. We
      had expected more of a hike to get to them.</p>

    <p>Because of significant amounts of recent rain, the water in the stream seemed reasonably
      high and the falls were in very good form. It might be interesting to return to these falls
      at a later time in the season to see what they are like.</p>

    <p>After spending some time at the falls, we decided to continue on to the pond. That hike
      involved a lot more climbing but it was interesting because it followed along the stream for
      some distance. The pond itself had a nice, remote feeling.</p>
