<h1>White Mountain Waterfalls</h1>
<p>This list will eventually be a fairly complete list of waterfalls in the White Mountains of New
  Hampshire. The entries in this list are brief, but the links take you to my full description of
  each of the falls (at least for the falls I've visited). Many of these falls I have not yet
  visited but hope to do so eventually.</p>

<p>There are many waterfalls in the White Mountains. Some are roadside attractions while others
  require a significant amount of hiking to reach. If you are interested in looking at waterfalls
  while in the White Mountains, then I strongly suggest picking up a copy of <i> <a
      href="references.html">Waterfalls of the White Mountains</a> </i> by Bruce and Doreen
  Bolnick. It is an excellent book on the subject.</p>

<p>The starting point for this list was sent to me by Brad Charbonneau. I've edited his list and
  added to it. There are still many more falls to add.</p>
