</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
  <b>From Northampton, MA</b>
</p>

<p>Take MA route 9 west out of <b>Northampton</b> to the small town of <b>Williamsburg</b>. This
  is a fairly short distance: only a few miles. In the center of Williamsburg, right by a gas
  station, turn north onto <b>North Street</b>. You will immediately cross a bridge and come to a
  four-way intersection. Go straight.</p>

<p>After a short distance, North Street will turn into <b>Ashfield Road</b>. Stay on Ashfield Road
  for several miles. It will cross into the town of <b>Conway</b>, where it becomes <b>Main Poland
    Road</b> and then, a mile or two later, it will cross into Ashfield, where it becomes <b>Williamsburg
    Road</b>. These town line crossings are marked, but you will have to watch for them. The signs
  are somewhat obscure.</p>

<p>After another mile or so, the road goes down a short but moderately steep hill and crosses <b>Chapel
  Brook</b>. There is some parking just past the small bridge on the left, but you could park
  along the roadside in several places nearby. There is a sign for the Chapel Brook reservation,
  but it isn't easy to see until you are pulling into (or driving by) the parking area.</p>

<p>From the parking area there is a trail that heads upstream. Don't go that way. The falls are on
  the other side of the road and downstream from the bridge. There is an old road (now more like a
  trail) that leaves the main road just before the bridge. Down that road a few yards is a sign
  pointing to an informal trail that leads to the falls. The trail is short. The falls are close
  to the road. The footing is a little tricky in places, but not bad. It shouldn't present a
  problem for anyone except the most unsteady. I do suggest wearing the appropriate footwear. The
  forest floor can be muddy.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

</p>

<p>Chapel Brook Falls is not a large waterfall, but it is a very pretty one. The main fall is the
  one farthest downstream. When you first come to the stream, you will be looking at a long
  sloping rock over which the stream flows in a narrow sheet. At the bottom of the sloping rock
  there is a large pool. Just below this first step is another, steeper sloping rock with another
  pool. Below that the main falls is a nearly vertical drop of about 15 feet.</p>

<p>There are plenty of rocks around, so it is easy to get right out near the water. In fact, you
  can stand just a few feet in front of the main falls without much trouble, making for a
  spectacular view. There is a pool below the main falls as well, offering some possibilities for
  wading.</p>

    <p>Today Hillary and I visited these falls for the second time. The weather was cloudy, and
      there were very few leaves on the trees, but the falls seemed very similar to last year in
      terms of the amount of water flowing over them. The lower falls seemed especially
      beautiful.</p>

    <p>Hillary and I also took some time to follow the trail across the road from the falls up to
      Chapel Ledge. It was a short walk and the view was nice. Although there were no waterfalls
      along the trail, I would still recommend it as an interesting side trip.</p>

    <p>Today my daughter Hillary and I visited Chapel Brook Falls for the first time. It was a
      beautiful, sunny fall day, and there were many fallen leaves around and in the stream. The
      sloping rocks above the main fall were covered with leaves. However, many leaves were still
      on the trees, painting the forest around the falls in yellows, reds, and oranges.</p>

    <p>Despite the dry summer, the water level in Chapel Brook seemed normal. It was easy enough
      to walk around on the rocks, but the stream still had plenty of water to make the falls look
      good.</p>

    <p>There were quite a few people around---not surprising considering the weather and the
      weekend. Most people seemed to be hiking upstream, however. I think there might be some sort
      of overlook that way. The falls themselves were relatively quiet.</p>
