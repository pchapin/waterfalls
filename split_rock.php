<h2>Directions</h2>
<p><b>From I-87</b></p>

<p>Split Rock Falls is easy to reach. From exit 30 on the Adirondack Northway (I-87) go northwest
  on NY route 9/73 toward Lake Placid for 2.4 miles (3.8 km) to a large, strange, but well-marked
  intersection. Take a right, continuing north on route 9 to a small bridge over the Boquet River
  just above Split Rock Falls. This point is 2.3 miles (3.7 km) from route 73 and 4.7 miles (7.5
  km) from the Northway (Coming from the north, the bridge is 3.9 miles (6.2 km) south of the New
  Russia post office).</p>

<p>Just over the bridge, coming from the south, there is a parking lot on the east (right) side of
  the road. No Parking signs surround the parking area on both sides of the road for some
  distance, so be aware that if the small lot is full (as it might be on a hot summer day) you may
  have to walk a distance to reach the falls. From the parking lot take one of several unmarked
  paths that lead along the edge of the steep-sided ravine and steeply down to the base of the
  falls. The distance from the parking area to the falls can be measured in feet. Explore the
  paths for different views of the falls and be sure to get to the very bottom, especially if you
  want to swim. Because it is so close to the road, the falls are a popular swimming spot and a
  good place to stop on the way to or from a day's hike in the nearby High Peaks.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Split Rock Falls is a very pretty spot. In high water the falls can be very powerful. The main
  falls consists of two drops, each about 15 feet in height. The upper drop is split in two by a
  mass of rock, hence the name. The two upper drops collect in a mid-level pool before dropping
  straight down another 15 feet over the lower drop. From here water flows through a steep, rocky
  ravine for about 50 yards, before making a beautiful cascade over little stones into a large,
  deep pool. The pool at the bottom is great for swimming. It's beautiful, deep (maybe up to 8
  feet in the middle), and sometimes fairly crowded. Although the falls are so close to the road,
  only from the main falls is a roadsign and the bridge just barely visible.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>May 2016</b></dt>

  <dd><p><i>Peter Chapin</i>. Today I visited these falls for the first time. They were indeed
    very lovely! The river was quite full due to the early season making for a spectacular scene
    (see the picture at the top of this page). I was less impressed with the lower falls, although
    taken by themselves they would have been somewhat interesting. The water was very cold today
    and nobody was swimming.</p></dd>

  <dt><b>January 16, 1999</b></dt>

  <dd><p><i>Jon Binder</i>. I was in the area, and decided the take the short detour to check out
    Split Rock falls in the winter. There was a lot of ice around, yet the falls were not actually
    frozen. The cascade at the bottom flowed over ice. It was interesting, but not that pretty.
    Also, it was slippery walking along the ravine, so I opted to return safely to the car.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>October 3, 1998</b></dt>

  <dd><p><i>Jon Binder</i>. I visited the falls on the way back from a hike up Cascade and Porter
    Mountains. I wanted to see the falls with some color around. No one else was there, and the
    falls had a good amount of water flowing. It was late in the afternoon, so the light was
    coming in beautifully; that along with the red leaves on the ground provided for a good
    picture.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>August 28, 1998</b></dt>

  <dd><p><i>Jon Binder</i>. I was on my way to an overnight trip in the High Peaks. I remembered
    Split Rock Falls was nearby, and because it wasn't a very hot or sunny day, I hoped the falls
    wouldn't be too crowded. I climbed down to the base of the cascade to find two men drying off
    next to the pool. They said how they liked to visit the falls on cloudy days since fewer
    people liked to swim then. I went for a swim, enjoying the solitude and the cold water! When I
    was walking back to the car, there was a kid jumping from the side of the ravine into the
    water between the main falls and the lower cascade. The water can be very strong here, so it's
    not something I would recommend. There's no way to tell how deep the water is, and you could
    hit a rock on the way down, or be pulled over the cascade by the current. In fact, not long
    ago a man drowned when he jumped in the swift, high water after a thunderstorm. It's safe to
    swim in the pool at the bottom, and probably more pleasant too.</p></dd>

  <dt><b>August 14, 1998</b></dt>

  <dd><p><i>Jon Binder</i>. Today I was looking at a contour map of the area, and noticed Split
    Rock Falls just a short distance from where I was. I had heard of the falls before, and had
    even seen a postcard of it in a store somewhere, but I didn't know where it was. I decided to
    try and locate it using the map. To my surprise, I easily found the falls, knowing I was at
    the right place because of the parking area on the right. There were about 4 cars parked here
    today. I followed one of the paths from the parking lot along the edge of the ravine, passing
    a fence at one point (which is meant to discourage people from getting to close to the edge or
    attempting to climb out onto the cliff next to the falls), and climbed steeply down to the
    base of the falls. There was a family swimming in the large pool, and a boy playing on the
    lower cascade (I wouldn't recommend that, it has to be very slippery, and a fall could mean
    hitting your head on the rocks). A woman was perched up on the rock next to the falls,
    ignoring the fence. The water wasn't too high, it was late, and the crowd was discouraging, so
    I left quickly. I was happy to find the falls, so I will be back very soon.
  </p></dd>

<p>Overall, Split Rock Falls is beautiful and easily accessible. It's a great swimming spot, but
  pick a day to go when it's somewhat cloudy if you don't want a crowd.</p>
