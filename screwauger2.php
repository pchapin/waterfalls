<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>There is another <a href="screwauger1.html">Screw Auger Falls</a> in Maine. It is in Grafton
  Notch State Park.</p>

<p>
  <b>From Milo, Maine</b>
</p>

<p>Starting at the center of Milo at the junctions of routes 6, 16, and 11 (0.0mi/0.0km), drive
  north on route 11 toward Brownville. At 12.9mi/20.6 km, turn west onto the road to Katahdin Iron
  Works. This turn is marked, but the road is a minor road, so watch for it. The road to the iron
  works is dirt, but it is of good quality. At 19.6mi/31.1km you will come to the old iron works.
  There you will have to stop and register before you can enter the Ki Jo-Mary multiple use
  forest. The attendant can give you up-to-date information on road and trail conditions. Maps of
  the area are also available there. When you return, you will have to check out.</p>

<p><img src="photos/screw21.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 10px" alt="Screw Auger Falls"
/>After registering, continuing driving along the road to the parking area at 26.3mi/42.0km. This
  parking area is on the north side of the road, and it is marked. The blue blazed trail leaves
  from the back of the parking area.</p>

<p>In a short distance, the trail connects to the Appalachian Trail. Almost immediately after that
  point, it crosses the Pleasant River. There is no bridge; wading is necessary. In low water,
  wading across the Pleasant River is easy enough (watch your step, the rocks are slippery). In
  high water it is impossible. There is another approach to the falls that involves more driving,
  more walking, and a smaller stream crossing. It may be possible to use that approach during
  high-water conditions. Ask the attendant at the Katahdin Iron Works.</p>

<p>Once on the other side of the river, the trail (now the Appalachian Trail) climbs gradually
  alongside the river, following it upstream. The walking is not too difficult, although the
  ground is rough. After about 1.5 miles, the Appalachian Trail turns north (right), and the trail
  you are interested in goes straight ahead. Soon it crosses Gulf Hagas Brook.</p>

<p>Turn left (downstream) and follow the brook toward Gulf Hagas. You will be following the Rim
  Trail. Screw Auger Falls is about halfway from the brook crossing to the Gulf. The distance from
  the brook crossing is not far. Before you reach the main part of Screw Auger Falls, you will go
  by an interesting lesser waterfall. Below the main part of the Screw Auger Falls, there is also
  another small drop that is worth investigating.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gulf Hagas, and the area immediately around it, is a waterfall enthusiast's paradise. Inside
  the gulf itself, there are no less than five named waterfalls. That is in addition to Screw
  Auger Falls just before the gulf. The entire hike along the rim of the gulf and back again is
  quite significant and should not be attempted without a full day to spend and proper
  preparations. This description only covers the more easily accessible Screw Auger Falls.</p>

<p>Gulf Hagas Brook tumbles down a steep slope on its way to the Pleasant River. On its way it
  forms several interesting cascades. It is not always easy to approach the brook from the Rim
  Trail. The terrain is rugged. However, there are three interesting drops that can be seen.</p>

<p>The first drop is only a short distance from the stream crossing I mentioned in the directions.
  The brook divides into two flows and both arch out gracefully over a rock face to splash into a
  pool at the bottom. The pool is nestled in a crevase in such a way as to give the spot a hidden,
  secluded feeling. Approaching these falls is tricky, and the scramble down to the water's edge
  should only be attempted with great care. Quite a few years ago, however, I once did go swimming
  in the pool below these unnamed falls.</p>

<p><img src="photos/screw22.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px" alt="Screw Auger Falls"
/> The main part of Screw Auger Falls is a bit farther down the trail. There a short side trail
  leads out onto a high, narrow outcropping of tree-covered rock. From there it is a fairly easy
  scramble down into a large, open bowl into which the falls flow. At the north end of the bowl,
  the falls drop impressively into a big pool. The stream then flows across the bottom of the
  bowl, through a narrow channel, and then on toward the Pleasant River.</p>

<p>It is easy to walk around among the broken rocks that are strewn about below the falls. The
  spot is fairly open to the sky and bright. In fact, it almost looks a little messy.</p>

<p>Farther down the trail there is another short side trail that approaches the brook. There the
  water flows over some low cascades that are covered over by the thick forest. This last drop is
  the lowest and least interesting of the drop. However, it is also the friendliest and in some
  ways the best for just sitting by the water. In addition, the swimming would probably be the
  best at these falls. One pool even had a bit of a gravel beach.</p>

    <b>Wedesday, August 12, 1997</b> <br/>

  <dd>
    <p>Today the weather was spitting rain when I left the parking area to go to the falls.
      Although the rain held off for most of my trip, it did start to come down pretty well by the
      time I returned to my car. I took pictures of the two upper falls today, but not of the
      lower falls.</p>
