<h1>Finger Lakes Waterfalls</h1>

<p>Although not really part of New England, I have visited some falls in nearby New York. In this
  document I will describe the falls I've seen in the Finger Lakes region. This is a rich area for
  waterfalls. If you are interested in waterfalls and are touring the Northeastern United States,
  be sure to check this region out. There are many more falls and gorges in that area than I have
  listed here!</p>

<p>These falls were visible from Rt 13 on the south edge of town. They were well-marked and easy
  to find. They were located in a state park with extensive facilities. Swimming in the pool at
  the base of the falls appeared to be encouraged, although when Hillary and I were there, the
  swimming was closed due to the lack of a lifegaurd. (It was an early morning).</p>

<p>The falls were quite beautiful. Just a few feet from the parking lot, the stream cascaded down
  a large, slanting rock face into a generous pool. The rock, as appeared to be typical for that
  area, was layered into thin, horizontal sheets. Thus, the water appeared to be taking hundreds
  of small steps on its way to the bottom.</p>

    Falls"/> Hillary and I crossed a wooden bridge at the outlet of the pool and then walked up
  the trail on the far side of the stream. The trail climbed steeply in places, but nicely formed
  steps made the ascent easy enough. The trail followed right alongside the stream, and soon we
  came to more cascades higher up. The state of New York discourages people from scrambling out on
  the rocks, although at one point it was clearly safe to do so and we did anyway! We visited
  three different sections of the falls, but there appeared to be even more higher up. It was hot,
  and we had other plans, so we didn't follow the trail to the end. I expect that it would be
  rewarding to do so, however.</p>

<h3>Wednesday, June 25, 1997</h3>

<p>This waterfall was easy to locate. Hillary and I travelled along Rt 89 north from Ithaca. Only
  a few miles outside of town, we came to the well-marked Taughannock Falls State Park. To see the
  falls, we had to park on the west side of the road. The parking area on the east side of the
  road was for the beach on Cayuga Lake.</p>

<p>We then hiked 0.75 miles along the Gorge Trail to reach the falls. The trail was as wide as a
  small road and very level. It was an easy hike, although it was very hot and humid the day we
  were there, and that made it somewhat uncomfortable. The trail stayed close to the stream, but a
  number of other people who were there just walked up the streambed. In some places there were
  large expanses of flat rock next to the stream, making such walking easy. In other places it was
  necessary to wade in the stream.</p>

<p>Below the falls, Taughannock Creek flows in a deep and rather spectacular gorge. The rim of the
  gorge was up to 400 feet above the floor. The south side was sloped enough to allow trees to
  take hold in many spots along the wall, but the north side was practically sheer. The
  steep-sided gorge made an interesting contrast with the nearly level floor where the stream
  flowed.</p>

<p><img src="photos/taughannock1.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 10px" alt="Taughannock
    Falls"/> The gorge ended in a large, amphitheater-like bowl. The walls were sheer all around.
  No trees could grow. At the head of the bowl, the stream poured from a notch and fell straight
  over 200 feet to a large pool at the bottom. Taughannock Falls is one of the highest single
  vertical drops in the East. At first, because there were no good points of reference, it was
  hard to tell how high the falls were. Then a few people scrambled down near the base of the
  falls (against the rules posted on the signs that warned of falling rock). With those people
  there for a scale, the true size of the waterfall became apparent. It was indeed very
  impressive!
