<p style="color: orange"><i>This website is in the process of being overhauled and modernized.
    Please excuse any breakage or inconsistencies while I work on this upgrade. This website has
    not been enhanced in a long time, so this will (hopefully!) be a welcome change when it is
    finally complete.</i></p>

<p>My name is Peter Chapin, and this is my page for waterfall enthusiasts. I pursue waterfalls as
  a hobby and as an excuse to get outside and into the woods. It's also an opportunity for me to
  practice with photography and website design. Enjoy the site; I hope you find it interesting and
  useful.</p>

<p><i>Note: If you are looking for Greg Parson's site supporting the book New England
    Waterfalls</i>, please go to <a href="https://www.newenglandwaterfalls.com/">NewEnglandWaterfalls.com</a>.
  It is an excellent site with lots of information about the same falls I cover here.</p>
