<p><i>This website is in the process of being overhauled and modernized. Please excuse any
    inconsistencies while I work on this upgrade. This website has not been enhanced in a long
    time, so this will (hopefully!) be a welcome change when it is finally complete.</i></p>

<p>My name is Peter Chapin, and this is my page for waterfall enthusiasts. I focus on the
  waterfalls of New England and neighboring regions (such as New York and bordering Canada). I
  pursue waterfalls as a hobby and as an excuse to get outside and into the woods. It's also an
  opportunity for me to practice with photography and website design. Enjoy the site; I hope you
  find it interesting and useful.</p>

          putting together some kind page or pages that will showcase the waterfalls visually.

          but aren't sure where to begin. The trips are presented by region to make it easier to
