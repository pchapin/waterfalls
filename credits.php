<h1>Credits</h1>

<p>First, I'd like to give special thanks to my friend <b>John Bedard</b> not only for his
  pictures of <a href="webb.html">Webb Falls</a>, <a href="wahconah.html">Wahconah Falls</a>, and
  <a
      href="niagara.html">Niagara Falls</a>, but especially for his accompanying me on several of
  my waterfall trips. John is a man who doesn't mind trudging around in the woods while surrounded
  by black flies and while carrying loads of camera equipment to look for obscure falls on
  insignificant streams. He has been a welcome companion.</p>

<p>I'd also like to especially thank my daughter <b>Hillary</b> for humoring my interest in
  waterfalls and joining me on several waterfall trips.</p>

<p>Finally, last but not least, I'd like to thank my wife, <b>Sharon</b> for also humoring my
  interest in waterfalls and for taking the time to explore some falls with me on our vacations.
</p>

<p>The following list contains the names of other people who have contributed to this site. These
  people all granted me permission to have their name posted here. If you would like to contribute
  something to my site but would rather not have your name mentioned, that is fine. Just let me
  know, and I will honor your request. The list below is alphabetical in last name.</p>

    like a great idea. Let me know if you are on this list and specifically want your email
    address posted. If I don't hear otherwise, I will assume you want your email address kept
    private.</i>
