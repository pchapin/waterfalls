<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
  <b>From the East</b>
</p>

<p>You want to ascend <a href="../100highest/camel.html">Camel's Hump</a> on the Forestry Trail.
  This trail leaves the Couching Lion Farm site on the east side of the mountain. Any book
  containing trail descriptions of the Camel's Hump trail system should provide directions to that
  spot. I provide rough directions below.</p>

<p>Follow VT route 100 south out of Waterbury, VT. Almost immediately after turning off of US
  route 2, turn right onto River Road. There is an informal sign there for the "Camel's Hump
  Trails." The road follows the Winooski River for some distance. After perhaps four miles (not
  measured) you will need to turn left, away from the river. This turn is also marked with an
  informal sign about "Camel's Hump Trails." The turn occurs in North Duxbury, but there is not
  much there, so you could easily miss it.</p>

<p>Follow this new road several more miles until it ends. It will veer to the right and become
  quite narrow just before ending. There is plenty of parking, however, since this is a major
  trail head for climbs on Camel's Hump. On the weekend when there is good weather, you may have
  trouble finding a parking spot only because of the large number of cars that will be there. Plan
  to arrive early on such days.</p>

<p>Take the Forestry Trail up the mountain. After about 1.3 miles, the Dean Trail comes in on the
  left. Take the right fork to continue on the Forestry Trail. At about 2 miles the trail
  approaches a small stream on the left. It will cross this stream a bit farther up, but you don't
  want to go that far. As soon as you seem to be close to the stream, start looking for an
  unmarked, but well-worn side trail on the left. This trail descends the short distance to the
  stream and then follows the stream a few yards to a spectacular overlook. The trail is a bit
  overgrown, but it is quite short. You can almost see the overlook through the trees from the
  main trail.</p>

<p>When you reach the overlook, you have arrived at the falls. This fact will be quite obvious
  when you get there!</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The small stream that flows over the falls is called Hump Brook in the Green Mountain Club's
  <i>Guide Book of the Long Trail</i>. I have not yet seen that name printed on any map. It is a
  good name, however, so I will use it.</p>

<p>In any case, the stream tumbles down a rough, but accessible channel and then, at the overlook
  I mentioned above, launches itself over a dramatic cliff. It drops about 50 feet in a single
  fall to a wide rock shelf below. There it collects itself again and flows over another 50-foot
  drop into the forest below.</p>

<p>The view from the overlook is worth taking in for its own merits. The bulk of the mountain
  rises up at your back, and before you is a large bowl filled with wild forest. The hills of the
  Green Mountains march away into the distance. To get a better view of the falls, you need to
  scramble down the cliff to the rock shelf below. This is difficult. Do not attempt to do this
  unless you are a very experienced hiker/climber. Beside the stream, the ground is not sheer, and
  it is covered thickly with scrubby trees. It is thus possible to pick a way down to the rock
  shelf by holding on to the tree trunks and forcing your way through the brush. It is not
  particularly fun.</p>

<p>At the rock shelf, the footing is good and comfortable. The view of the falls at that point is
  spectacular. They tower above you and are right next to you. It is easy to imagine stepping
  under them the way you might step into a shower (although I expect that the force of the water
  after falling that distance would be considerable). That spot allows you to get up very close
  and personal with the waterfall.</p>

<p>I have never attempted to find a way down the second cliff to the forest floor below. I would
  imagine that the falls would be quite spectacular from that location. From the bottom you would
  be able to see both drops, one on top of the other, in the same view, and I'm sure it would be
  lovely.</p>

<p>I have no photographs of these falls. The two times I have visited them in my life have both
  been times without my camera. I would expect that getting a good photograph would be difficult.
  The view of the falls from the overlook is poor: at that point you are standing right at the
  upper lip of the drop. The view of the falls from the rock shelf, while spectacular, is very
  close to the water and might be hard to capture properly on film. Furthermore, it would only
  really be half the waterfall. A proper photograph, it seems to me, would have to be taken from
  the bottom, and that would be a difficult descent to make while laden with camera equipment.</p>

<p>This is a very fine waterfall, and yet it does not seem to be widely known. There is no mention
  of it in any of the hiking guide books that I have, nor is it marked on any map that I've seen.
  I discovered it by accident some years ago while hiking with my friend, Sarah.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>Today my friend <a href="http://www.nikolaidis.com/">Peter Nikolaidis</a> and I climbed
      Camel's Hump by way of the Forestry Trail. Naturally, I told him that we should stop and see
      these falls and he agreed. The weather was perfect. It was cool, but not cold, and it was
      clear. The sky was a deep blue and the trees, approaching their height of color, where
      yellow and gold.</p>

    <p>To get to the falls themselves, we had to push through some underbrush and then walk a
      short distance in the stream itself. It was totally beautiful. The crystal clear water of
      the stream poured over some moss-covered rocks into a few shallow pools. There were yellow
      leaves all about. It seemed peaceful and calming. We sat on the rocks above the falls and
      took in the view and the sound of the rushing water. Despite this being a rather dry season,
      there was still enough water in the stream to make things interesting.</p>

    <p>We did not try to scramble down the side of the falls today.</p>
