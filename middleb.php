<h1>Middlebury Gorge</h1>
<pre>
Location: Middlebury, VT
Stream  : Middlebury River
</pre>
<hr/>
<h3>Saturday, May 27, 1995</h3>

<p>Along Rt. 125 just after crossing into Middlebury from Ripton, the Middlebury River passes
  through a deep, narrow gorge. There were no signs, but my friend, John, and I found a turn-off
  on Rt. 125 at about the right spot and parked there.</p>

<p>The turn-off was not very senic. In fact, quite a lot of trash had been thrown over the side of
  the road at that point and had collected into big piles a few feet below the road. Furthermore,
  there were lots of dead and rotting animal carcasses strewn about among the trash. Apparently
  this was a favorite spot for depositing road kills.</p>

<p>There were a couple of other cars parked in the turnoff, and there we met someone who had just
  been fishing in the gorge. He pointed out a faint trail that leads steeply downhill through a
  pine forest to the water.</p>

<p>The gorge itself was not particularly impressiveâ€”at least not where we were. There were some
  interesting cliffs along the side of the stream, but we didn't see any particularly interesting
  waterfalls. There were quite a few bugs.</p>

<p>Return to the <a href="list.html">list of waterfalls</a>.</p>
