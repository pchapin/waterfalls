# Waterfalls of New England

Waterfalls of the New England Region. This repository contains my waterfall website. You can
find the site online at
[https://www.pchapin.org/waterfalls](https://www.pchapin.org/waterfalls). It is my intention to
keep this URL stable for the foreseeable future.

The site uses Bootstrap 5.3.3, but the introduction of Bootstrap into the site is still in the
early stages. PHP is also used, but currently only to manage file inclusions (e.g., of the
signature into every page). It is my plan to eventually use PHP to query a database of waterfall
information.

This repository makes use of Git LFS. Be sure you have Git LFS installed before you clone this
repository. If the command `git lfs version` returns an error about how `lfs` is an unknown Git
command, then you do *not* have Git LFS installed, and you will need to address that.

It has been a long time since I've worked on this page, but I hope to change that in the comming
weeks/months. I have a lot of organization and stylistic changes in mind, as well as potential
new features to add. Finally, and of course, I hope to also visit more waterfalls and gather new
trip reports and pictures to add here.

Enjoy!
