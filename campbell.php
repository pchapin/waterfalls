<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>These directions are current as of April 1996</p>

<p>The Falls are located in a state forest right on the border between Massachusetts and
  Connecticut. Locating the falls is a bit tricky. From the center of <span
      class="town-name">Southfield</span>, take the <span class="road-name">Norfolk Road</span>
  south. Only a few feet before entering Connecticut, there is an old, rusted sign on the right
  that points down a dirt road called <span class="road-name">Campbell Falls
    Road</span>. Follow that road for a short distance until it crosses the <span
      class="stream-name">Whitney River</span>. There really aren't any signs or parking areas.
  However, there are a couple of wide places in the road where you can turn off.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Whitney River flows under the road and almost at once over the falls. The state of
  Massachusetts has put up some fences by the road to discourage foolish people from diving into
  the falls. However, the fences don't actually go all the way down the ravine. The falls still
  feel wild.</p>

<p>Campbell Falls actually has two sections; an upper part that is higher and then a lower part.
  The stream flows through a short, rocky trench between the two falls. The best view is, as is
  often the case, from below. There is a rough, unmarked trail leaving the road on the left side
  of the stream that takes you down to the pool at the base of the falls. It's a short walk but a
  bit of a scramble in places (no problem for an experienced hiker).</p>

    <p>My friend John and I were in the New Marlborough area doing some genealogical research
      today. I told him that no visit to New Marlborough would be complete without stopping by
      Campbell Falls. John readily agreed.</p>

    <p>The falls were in good form when we stopped to see them. Everything was more or less
      exactly like it was last year, except that the weather was sunnier. We only stopped for
      enough time to climb down to the bottom of the falls and snap a few pictures.</p>

    <p>John and I also visited <a href="umpachene.html"><span

    <p>I visited these falls on my way home from a hikeq to <a href="race.html"><span
        class="waterfall-name">Race Brook Falls</span> </a>. It was getting rainy and dark, but
      I'm glad I stopped. Campbell Falls was an impressive sight!</p>

    <p>I first went down the west side of the stream. I was able to get a very interesting picture
      of the main falls, but I was not able to climb all the way to the bottom that way. However,
      by taking the trail on the east side of the stream, just past the fences, I was able to go
      all the way down to the water's edge just below the falls. From there I could get a nice
      view of the falls, including both the large, impressive upper section and the smaller lower
      section. By scrambling over some rocks, I was able to sit at the mouth of the ravine and
      watch just the upper falls in their full glory.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The water level in the river was high, and the falls made quite a thunderous roar. I could
      easily feel the spray wash over me from my vantage point at the mouth of the ravine. Very
      impressive.</p>
