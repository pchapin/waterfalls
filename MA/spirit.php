<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
  <b>From the center of Royalston</b>
</p>

<p>Follow route 68 west out of town for about 0.6 miles. On the left you will see a small sign for
  the Jacob Hill Reservation, a property owned by <span class="other-name">The
        Trustees of Reservations</span>. There is a small turnout there with space for two or
  three cars. Some additional cars can park along the road.</p>

<p><img src="photos/spirit2.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 10px" alt="Spirit Falls"/> At the
  back of the turnout a yellow blazed trail leads to the falls. It is consistently marked, but the
  marking is not always obvious. The trail is not heavily traveled, and in places it is a bit
  obscure. About halfway to the falls another yellow blazed trail forks to the right. If you are
  not alert you might miss this fork and end up following the wrong trail. Take the left-hand fork
  to the falls. The right-hand fork climbs to the ridge where it joins another trail. Along the
  ridge to the right (uphill) the trail leads to a nice overlook with a beautiful view of <span
      class="other-name">Long Pond</span> and <span
      class="stream-name">Tully River</span>. Along the ridge to the left (downhill) the trail
  leads to the falls and loops back to become the left hand fork.</p>

<p>The direct route to the falls keeps more or less level and soon begins to border alongside a
  marsh. This marsh is part of Little Pond, a spring-fed body of water that is the headwaters for
  Spirit Falls. The trail then comes to a stream flowing out of the marsh, and it turns to follow
  that stream downhill. After a few yards, the trail makes an abrupt right-hand turn to follow the
  ridge uphill toward the overlook I mentioned above. You should leave the trail at this point and
  continue following the stream downhill. There is an informal, unmarked trail that you can
  follow. In a short distance you will come to the upper part of Spirit Falls. A little ways
  beyond that you will come to the larger, lower part of the falls.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Spirit Falls is a waterfall surrounded by forest. Tall trees grow up on either side of the
  small stream that flows over the waterfall, making the spot very well shaded. Little Pond, the
  source of the stream, is a swampy body of water without an inlet. The water in the stream
  flowing out of it is stained brown by the tannic acid liberated by all the decaying vegetation
  in the swamp. To be honest, I find the color a bit disconcerting. Although it is not due to
  human pollution, most New England waterfalls have crystal clear streams flowing over them. The
  brownish water flowing over these falls took some getting used to.</p>

<p><img src="photos/spirit4.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px" alt="Spirit Falls"/> The upper
  falls are only a few yards below the bend in the trail that I mentioned in the directions. They
  are about ten feet high and flow over a large, mostly flat outcropping of rock in a single drop.
  It is a nice waterfall, although not very remarkable.</p>

<p>The lower falls are the main event. They are located about 30 yards or so below the upper
  falls. To get the best view, however, you should plan to scramble down the steep hillside to the
  bottom of the cascade. Don't try this scramble unless you have some experience with hiking on
  rough, steep terrain. The ground is wet and slippery in spots, and it would be easy to have an
  accident there.</p>

<p>The stream spills over several rock steps and then flows among some rocks and boulders at the
  bottom of the falls before collecting itself together again. There are some nice places at the
  bottom of the falls where you can stand on the rocks and get a perfect view of the water as it
  splashes downwards. I imagine that these falls are quite spectacular in the spring, although
  climbing down to the bottom of them would probably be rather treacherous at that time as
  well.</p>

<p>Spirit Falls is a nice waterfall located in the woods. If you are in Royalston looking at
  waterfalls (such as <a href="royalston.html">Royalston Falls</a> or <a href="doanes.html"
  >Doane's Falls</a>), don't forget to check this one out as well. However, my guess is that
  during low-water season these falls might be nearly dry.</p>

    <p>Peter Adams, a reader of this website, visited these falls and emailed me message with some
      more information. I quote him below.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I think the trails at the park have been recently reblazed, as it was very easy to follow
        the trail. We didn't have a map, so we didn't know about the overlook on the right before
        the falls. Too bad we didn't know about your site beforehand! Another apparent change is
        that the trail now continues past the falls all the way down to the reservoir on the Tully
        River. That was a welcome surprise and respite from the heat and mosquitoes! Once at the
        bottom, though, we couldn't figure out anything to do but trudge back the way we came. The
        path at the bottom (yellow and orange blazes for hikers and bikes) didn't seem to lead us
        in a useful direction, though perhaps one would eventually have led us up the ridge.</p>

    <p>Today my friend John and I visited these falls. We didn't take the most direct route to
      them because we weren't quite sure where we were going. We ended up visiting the overlook
      first. However, it was a worthwhile stop. The sky was clear today (although it was also a
      bit warm) and the view was great. When we finally found the falls, we spent quite a bit of
      time scrambling around them and taking pictures. I took several pictures, but I had to go to
      1/4 second exposures to get enough light (ASA 200 and ASA 100 film). That should give you
      some idea of what the spot is like. I'm glad I thought to bring my tripod.</p>

    </p>

    <p>There were plenty of bugs around today. Although strangely there were not very many near
      the falls. Perhaps I just didn't notice them.</p>
