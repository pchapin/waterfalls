<h1>Other New Hampshire Waterfalls</h1>
<p>
  <i>The following falls in New Hampshire (and some just across the border in Maine) were brought
    to my attention by various people. These are all falls that I have not yet seen myself. As I
    visit these falls, I will take them off this list and add them to my main list. The
    information here may overlap somewhat with my list of <a
        href="wmfalls.html">White Mountain waterfalls</a>.</i>

  <i>The following notes were sent to me by Dean Goss on June 27, 1997. Thank you, Dean for this
    information! Dean has also sent me information about some <a
        href="vtwater.html">Vermont waterfalls</a> as well.</i>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Pond Brook Falls</b> in the Nash Stream Reserve north of Stark. This is loosely modeled
    on Step Falls but nowhere near the size. A few minor cascades above a long granite chute
    through which the water races, and a few minor cascades below. A great western exposure would
    make for great photos, alas the sun was out, so I bagged taking any shots.
  </li>

  <li><b>Dixville Flume</b>: Rt. 26 just past The Balsams. A miniature version of the Franconia
    flume, no hike required.
  </li>

  <li><b>Huntington Cascades</b>: about .5 miles east of the Dixville Flume. A short walk to an
    extremely photogenic waterfall, with another nice waterfall just upstream. The lower falls are
    a 15' drop where the stream splits into 3 chutes. The upper falls is a 40' drop no more than
    2-3' wide. Both here and at Dixville Flume the sun was kind enough to vanish in the haze
    allowing me the comparative luxury of .5-2 second exposures.
  </li>

  <li><b>Mother Walker Falls</b>: Grafton Notch, Maine. A very small waterfall in the "cave"
    formed between the gorge wall, and a <em>huge</em> talus boulder. Difficult to see, but a neat
    formation.
  </li>

  <li><b>Thompson Falls</b> in Pinkham Notch, very early in the AM. What a great waterfall! Do you
    have <a href="references.html">Bruce Bolnick's "Waterfalls of the White Mountains?"</a> If so,
    his description of the lowest falls is dead accurate. It looks like water cascading over the
    lip of a giant clamshell. The sun was very low in the eastern sky, allowing a full 3 seconds
    of exposure. I got the photos back, and was blown away by the results. The chutes and other
    cascades above are equally beautiful. This was a very nice waterfall encounter.
  </li>

  <li><b>Crystal Cascade</b>, well, not quite. Even though I reached the Pinkham's Notch
    campground at 6:15 AM, the crowd on the trail was legion! I bolted for the car.
  </li>

  <li><b>Winneweta Falls</b>, in Jackson. The mosquitos were awful, but miraculously absent at the
    falls. This waterfall was very attractive, a 30' set of steps over mossy rock. The only
    drawback was that all the ideal vantage points for the purpose of photography were in midair
    in the gorge. I eventually got my shots by climbing up the face of the falls and standing in
    the flow.

  <i>The following falls are all located in northern New Hampshire (above the White Mountains).
    These were brought to my attention by Kim Nilsen. He is the president of the Cohos Trail
    Association. All of these falls are on the proposed Cohos Trail—a 140-mile trail system that
    the Cohos Trail Association is in the process of planning and building. If you are interested
    in joining the association, write to Kim Nilsen, Cohos Trail Association, 252 Westmoreland Rd,
    Keene, NH 03431.</i>

  <i>Note that the two falls in Dixville are also mentioned in Dean Goss's notes above.</i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Huntington Falls</b>, Dixville</li>
  <li><b>Flume Brook</b>, Dixville</li>
  <li><b>Pond Brook Falls</b>, Nash Stream Forest, Stratford</li>
  <li><b>Garfield Falls</b>, Pittsburg</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <i>Kim also mentioned Moose Falls directly off Route 3 on the right, running away from the road,
    in the vicinity of Deer Mountain Campground in Pittsburg.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>In a later note, Kim added:</i>
</p>

<p>"There are also some very remote falls in the backcountry, most of which are very difficult to
  get to, in terms of time and access."</p>

<p>"In the Second College Grant and Pittsburg/Clarksville area in New Hampshire, there are two
  "squeeze hole" falls, which were well known in the days of the river drive loggers. They are
  Hells Gate Falls and Little Hells Gate Falls, both of which are narrow passages and brief drops
  in the Dead Diamond River. These falls used to hang up the log drives in some years because it
  was easy for logs to jam into the narrow passes."</p>

<p>"There are also several remote mountain gorges through which water descends. They are not
  falls, but they are beautiful areas with steep or cliff-like walls. One is accessed through a
  gate just off Route 16 a few feet before it passes into northern Maine from New Hampshire. This
  is the access road to the Second College Grant. By walking in a mile, you arrive at a beautiful
  gorge."</p>

<p>"The other is Canyon Gorge on the so-called Canyon Trail in the farthest northeast region of
  Pittsburg hard by the Canadian Border and in Indian Stream, at its very source. I have yet to
  see it, as it takes a terrible amount of time to get there. Yet it is one of the very few
  natural features in the far north that has ever had a trail cut in to it."</p>

  <i>The following notes were sent to me by Roy Sunter on June 22, 1998. These are falls in
    south-western New Hampshire.</i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Pulpit Falls</b></p>

    <p>From the intersection of Rts 119, 10, &amp; 78 in Winchester, NH, travel S on Rt 10
      (towards Northfield, MA). After about 2.6 miles, the road will be winding downhill, curving
      to the right. Look for a pull-off on the right immediately after the curve, and a jeep trail
      on the left. Park in the pull-off and take the jeep trail on foot.</p>

    <p>There are one or two signs painted on rocks pointing out "Falls Trail," or some such; but I
      have never had any luck following these; they always seem to peter out, and I end up
      bushwhacking. The falls are easy enough to find this way; just follow the sound of running
      water to the brook's edge and head upstream.</p>

    <p>The falls themselves are not particularly high (maybe 10–15 ft total drop), but if you're
      bushwhacking upstream along the brook's edge, their sudden appearance is quite dramatic. The
      undergrowth you've been pushing through suddenly opens up at a bend in the stream, affording
      an unobstructed view of the falls. Depending on the time of year, there can be up to three
      separate, parallel cascades, the middle one in free space, the others following the rock
      bed.</p>

    <p>A trail continues upstream through some interesting rock ledges and ends at a small beaver
      pond.</p>

    <p>This is a rather modest little waterfall and may not warrant a day trip of itself; but it's
      worth adding to your itinerary if you've planned a trip to some of the other nearby falls
      already mentioned on your page (<a href="royalston.html">Royalston Falls</a>, <a
          href="doanes.html">Doanes Falls</a>, <a href="spirit.html">Spirit Falls</a>).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b>Fay Falls</b></p>

    <p>From the center of Walpole, NH, take Prospect Hill Road, and about 0.2 mi later bear right
      onto County Road. Follow County Road through some very scenic country for about 3.5
      miles.</p>

    <p>The falls are not visible from the road, and the landmarks I use to find them are somewhat
      subtle. After you've traveled for about 3.5 miles on County Road, you should be bearing
      uphill and turning rather sharply to the left. Look for a white farm gate on the left and a
      jeep trail on the right. I have not visited the falls since I was a teenager, and the jeep
      trail was not there at that time, so I cannot say for sure if it leads to the falls; but it
      will certainly take you near enough the water to hear it, from which point anyone with any
      experience hunting waterfalls should be able to find them.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you might continue on County Rd for a few more tenths of a mile. The road
      crosses the stream just as the woods give way to open field and a gorgeous open-topped
      drumlin on your left. There's enough room to squeeze your car off the road. Bushwhack
      downstream from there to the falls. Be forwarned, though, that you may pass through or near
      private property along the way.</p>

    <p>The falls themselves drop perhaps 20–25 feet, and during the summer may slow to a trickle.
      Their most interesting feature for me was the talus caves large enough for a chubby
      13-year-old to squeeze into and emerge from behind the cascade. That same 13-yr old gave no
      thought to the fact that wild animals resentful of his intrusion might call those caves home
      and take unkindly to his sudden appearance. With that caveat (pun intended) in mind, these
      falls are worth including in a day trip to the unsung wild places in the Monadnock Region of
      N.H., if not justifying a trip to themselves.</p>
