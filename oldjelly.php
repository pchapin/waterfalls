<h3>Sunday, March 21, 2004</h3>

<p>In December 2003 Craig Erickson sent me the following in email.</p>

<p><i>The Old Jelly Mill (you saw what was left since it burned down many years ago) was an almost
  magical place which I visited frequently in the 1960's. They served exquisite coconut custard
  pie and hot cider. They sold candles and other touristy stuff; however, the building was old and
  authentic to a wooden peg (no ORIGINAL nails).</i></p>

<p><i>As for the falls, in the spring at peak snow melt time, they were very dramatic. As can be
  seen in your photo, the rocks descend in several tiers. You photographed water showing only on
  the side which is away from the road. In peak melt the water spanned the entire width of your
  photo and created several different tiers of falls.</i></p>

<p><i>Thanks for hiking around and rekindling some very fond and vivid memories.</i></p>

<p>I visited these falls with a woman I just met named Anna.</p>

<p>The falls were located in <span class="town-name">Dummerston</span> just off <span
    class="road-name">Rt. 30</span>. There was some possibility that we were not actually at the
  falls. The map I'm using (<a href="references.html">The Vermont Atlas and Gazetteer</a> by the
  DeLorme Mapping Company of Freeport Maine, 1988 edition) is not always totally accurate when it
  comes to locating its waterfall symbols. In the case of Old Jelly Mill Falls, the map showed
  them on <span class="stream-name">Stickney Brook</span> about a mile or so back from Rt. 30.
  However, when Anna and I explored the back roads in the vicinity, we saw nothing to indicate
  that there were any falls nearby. We didn't bother to climb into the ravine where the brook was
  but we couldn't hear the brook at all from the road, so the falls---if they were there---must
  not have been very noisy.</p>

<p>In contrast, right at the junction of Rt. 30 and a side road, Stickney Brook does fall over a
  series of small steps forming a variety of interesting little falls. It was also clear that
  there had once been a building of some sort in the area. We could see stone work along the brook
  in a couple of places. Perhaps the stone work was the remains of Old Jelly Mill.</p>

<p>The falls were not spectacular as waterfalls go, but they were quite beautiful. Fall foliage
  was at its prime. There were many colored leaves floating in the water and drifting down from
  the trees above. The stream was not especially full, and it winded back and forth across its
  channel as it went from step to step.</p>

<p>Anna and I sat and listened to the water for a while at several spots along the stream. I took
  a few pictures. She suggested that I also try to get photographs of the falls at various
  seasons, including winter. She thought that many falls would be especially beautiful during the
  winter. That sounds like a good idea to me, so maybe I'll try to do that. It would at least be a
  good excuse to go back to all the falls again! In any case, Old Jelly Mill falls would be a good
  place to start during winter. It's quite close to the road, and it would require very little
  plodding through snow to get at.</p>

<p>Overall, these were an interesting fall, but not spectacular. They would be worth stopping at
  if you were driving by, but don't plan your vacation around seeing them.</p>
