<p>I have not yet "officially" visited these falls myself. However, I have seen them many years
  ago. There is a web page prepared by the state of Massachusetts on <a
      href="http://www.state.ma.us/dem/parks/bash.htm">Bash Bish Falls State Park</a>.</p>

<p>Return to the <a href="list.html">list of waterfalls</a>.</p>
