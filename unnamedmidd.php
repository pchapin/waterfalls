<h1>Unnamed Falls in Middlebury Gap</h1>
<p>Sometimes you see surprising things. During the spring run-off season, two impressive falls
  appear on the east side of Middlebury Gap in Vermont's Green Mountains. As far as I know, they
  have no name. They are also not particularly easy to approach. However, they are very
  interesting and worthwhile waterfalls.</p>

<p>In this document I will describe both of them, although I have so far only spent much time with
  one.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Both falls can be approached if you park your car at the turnout on the south side of Rt 125
  located 4.4 miles west of Hancock and 1.9 miles east of Middlebury Gap. There are no signs. In
  the summer these falls are not visible from the road. In fact, I doubt if they even exist.
  However, both are visible from the road (if you are alert) during the time after the main
  snowmelt and before the leaves have grown on the trees.</p>

<p>There are two falls involved. The "upper" one is uphill from the turnout a short distance and
  relatively near the road. The "lower" one is downhill from the turnout about the same distance
  and well back from the road.</p>

<p>These falls were easy to see from the road today. They were, however, on the far side of the
  stream that paralleled the road. To get to the falls, I had to cross that stream, and that was a
  bit difficult. With proper wading gear, it would have been easy enough, but the water was much
  too cold and swift to wade barefoot. I was able to get across by walking on a tree that had
  fallen over the stream, but I ended up getting a bit wet anyway.</p>

<p><img src="photos/unnamedmidd4.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 10px"
        alt="Unnamed Falls"/> The falls cascaded down the steep ground toward the stream below.
  The rocks around the falls were covered with vegetation, including many ferns that were just
  starting to grow again after a long winter (spring came late to Vermont this year). The ground
  was covered with large boulders and footing was difficult. It would have been easy to
  accidentally put a foot into a leaf-covered crack between two boulders and break a leg. I do not
  recommend that you approach these falls unless you are comfortable with bushwhack hiking over
  difficult terrian.</p>

<p>The falls were exquisitely beautiful, however. As the water splashed and played its way from
  rock to rock, it looked like a true deep forest waterfall cascading through thick, moist
  vegetation. It was the very icon of a mountain stream. Higher up the stream spilled into a large
  (20 or 30 foot) rock chute. As it did so, it arced outwards in a graceful curve. Truly, these
  falls were a wonderful find!</p>

<h2>The Lower Falls</h2>
<p>I have not yet investigated these falls, although I have seen them from the road below the
  turnout. They are well back from the road, but they appear to fall down the same formation as
  the upper falls I described above. The same stream needs to be crossed, and then you would need
  to bushwack into the woods perhaps 100 yards to the falls themselves. I will try to check these
  falls out during the 1998 season.</p>
